## Assessment

The Project, which we titled "Precious Medals", was a project centered around building a machine learning model that could predict the medals a nation should win. This model was based on certain indexes, related to human development, gender inequality and overall GDP. 

I had the Circle role in the project, my responsibilities centered around helping organize and clean the data, in order to create a data frame we could use for our dashboard and visual representation of the data, as well as being able to create a predictive model to use. As we went on beyond helping with how to create our machine learning model, I specifically took charge putting the tableau story and dashboards together and then linking it to a javascript page, as well as putting the presentation together. 

To help out with the other tasks we had on our team, I worked with Seva to write the python code in order to clean the data to creae the dataframe. Aside from working together via zoom meeting during class time, we also got together Friday and Sundays every week. Every session we got together, we would present what we had been working on ansd what issues or struggles we were currently having. whatever the most pressing issue of that session is, we would sit and discuss and work out the possible solutions. 

The hardest part of the challenge personally was going beyond what i heard learned in tableau to create more interactive charts and dashboards. with the data we had to use, it was very small and limiting on how much we could string the data in order to present it and create a working machine learning model. We had to try new things with our model, and run multiple different learning models in order to get a working one. We were put in the position of our predictive model give us a low R^2 or even a negative R^2. We decided to change our "GDP per Capita" to GDP, which helped changed the course of the predictive model. 

As a team, everyone was focused on helping and working through the various parts of the project together. Through all the parts of the project, everyone was focused on there own tasks but also very much involved in every task through this project. constant communication between the members of the group through slack and zoom was key to being involved in every facet of the project to make sure that it was completed and well done in all aspects. 

At the end, this Project goal was to be able to write a predictive model that could predict relatively well how many olympic medals a nation should be able to win, based on social and economic indexes. We used both Neural Netowrk and Forest Regression to do this, and were able to get a 52% predictive capability.
